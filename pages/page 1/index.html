        <p>I was born on May 1, 2005 and live in Project 4, Quezon City. My family is a bit different - my parents are separated, but I have a younger brother who I'm very close with. Even though my mom and dad don't live together, they both make sure to spend time with me and my brother. We may not be a traditional family, but I'm still happy and feel very loved.

            From a young age, I've been passionate about basketball. As a child, I loved playing the sport and would spend hours practicing my dribbling and shooting. One day, I had the opportunity to see one of my basketball idols, Marc Pingris, play in a game. This inspired me even more to work hard and improve my skills on the court.
            
            In elementary school, I had a wonderful time. I loved going to school and learning new things every day. My teachers were kind and always encouraged me to do my best. I made lots of friends and we would play games together at recess. I have so many fun memories from that time - like the school talent show where I performed a silly dance routine, and the field trip we took to the zoo where I got to feed the giraffes. Elementary school was a carefree and joyful part of my childhood.</p>

        <p>After a fun and easy elementary school time, I started my high school years at the National College of Business and Arts (NCBA). This new part of my life was full of excitement and exploring new things. In high school, I was very eager to try new things and find out what I'm interested in. I joined different clubs, from the student council to the digital media club, which let me develop new skills and interests outside of my classes. High school had more difficult challenges, but I really wanted to do well. There were times when I had trouble with the increased work and pressure, but I learned important lessons about managing my time and not giving up. High school was also a period of a lot of personal growth as I dealt with the changes of being a teenager and learned more about myself. My strong desire to get better at basketball also grew during these high school years, as I spent more time practicing and improving my skills on the court.</p>

        <p>After an eventful and formative high school journey, I transitioned into the next phase of my education at FEU Tech, where I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a major in Web and Mobile Applications (BSIT WMA). This program allows me to focus on developing skills in web and mobile app development, which aligns perfectly with my interests. In my first year of college so far, I've learned that every moment of my time is precious, as there are so many things to do and work on. Effective time management has become crucial, requiring me to be wise in how I allocate my time each day. I want to make the most of my college experience by striking the right balance between my academics, extracurricular activities, and personal growth. With dedication and prudent time usage, I am confident I can thrive in this new chapter and lay a strong foundation for my future career.During my college years, I've also had the happiness of meeting and getting to know my beautiful girlfriend, Deyths. She is a lively, caring, and curious person who has brought so much joy into my life. Deyths' bright smile and kind heart always make me feel better, and her constant support has been very helpful as I deal with the difficulties of being in university. Together, we have gone on many fun adventures, and we have built a strong connection based on respect, trust, and a shared interest in learning and growing as individuals. Deyths' presence in my life has truly made my college experience richer, and I am grateful to have the chance to build a meaningful relationship with such a wonderful person.</p>
