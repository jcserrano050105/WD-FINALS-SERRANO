            <p>Even before going to college, I had a natural talent for art, spending my teenage years honing my skills in drawing and painting. When I started university, I expanded my creative abilities by teaching myself graphic design and digital illustration, while also developing an interest in technology and teaching myself to program in C++ and HTML/CSS. During college, I continued refining my varied skill set, using my knowledge of coding languages to make impressive web projects that showcased my abilities in both front-end and back-end development, complemented by my strong drawing and design talents. This unique blend of creative and technical skills has made me a well-rounded individual, as demonstrated by a simple portfolio website I created that combines visually appealing design with functional web development. This diverse expertise has positioned me for success in a variety of professional fields upon graduation.</p>

            <p>I really enjoy a variety of hobbies in my free time. My main passion is playing basketball - I've been shooting hoops since I was a kid and I love the competitive thrill of the game. More recently, I've also taken up biking and swimming as ways to stay active. There's something very peaceful and meditative about going for a long bike ride or swimming laps in the pool. And when the weather is nice, I also really enjoy going hiking in the nearby trails and parks. Being out in nature, breathing in the fresh air, and taking in the beautiful scenery is so rejuvenating for me. Overall, I try to keep an active and varied lifestyle with all the different hobbies I pursue.     </p>

            <p>My main interest in life is to learn more about programming, focusing on HTML, Java, and C++. I really want to gain a lot of experience and knowledge during my time in college, so I can have a good job in the future. Beyond just improving my technical skills, I am also very motivated to make my parents proud and give them the life they deserve. This mix of school goals, career plans, and family dedication is what drives my passion and shapes how I see things. I know that by putting all my effort into my studies and training, I will be able to get a well-paying job that allows me to support my family and be financially stable. At the same time, I hope that my achievements will inspire my younger brothers and sisters and show them the value of getting a higher education and working hard. I want to set a good example for them and pave the way for them to have their own success. Ultimately, my interests and goals are not just about my own future, but about helping my whole family and leaving a positive impact on them.</p>
