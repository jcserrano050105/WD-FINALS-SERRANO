        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My teenage years were a time of growth and self-discovery.<sup>1</sup> High school in <strong><i>Jose Abad Santos</i></strong> brought new challenges and opportunities, and I embraced them with enthusiasm.<sup>2</sup> I made new friends and expanded my horizons, learning more about myself and the world around me.<sup>3</sup> Like many teenagers, I experienced ups and downs, navigating the complexities of friendships, relationships, and schoolwork.<sup>4</sup> There were moments of joy and triumph, as well as moments of heartache and disappointment.<sup>5</sup> But through it all, I remained resilient and determined to persevere, always willing to learn and grow.<sup>6</sup> Music became a passion of mine during my teenage years.<sup>7</sup> I taught myself how to play the guitar and spent countless hours practicing.<sup>8</sup> Music became an outlet for me, a way to comfort myself and make sense of the world.<sup>9</sup> I also developed a love for basketball during my high school years.<sup>10</sup> I played with my friends almost every day and even tried out for the school team to gain more experience.<sup>11</sup> Additionally, during my senior high school years, I had the unique opportunity to be part of an online class at the <strong><i>University of the East</i></strong>.<sup>12</sup> This experience exposed me to a different mode of learning and helped me develop essential skills in time management and self-discipline.<sup>13</sup> I studied in the <b><i>TVL - ICT</i></b> strand which made me develop some skills in java programming.<sup>14</sup> I enjoyed learning programming thats why I chose to study <b><i>BSIT</i></b> in college.<sup>15</sup> I learned a lot during those online class days and it's somewhat helpful because there is no hassle in transporting from our house to my school.<sup>16</sup>  As I approached the end of high school, I began to think about my future and what path I wanted to take.<sup>17</sup> It was a time of reflection and decision-making as I considered my interests, strengths, and goals for the future.<sup>18</sup> Overall, my teenage years were a time of growth, learning, and exploration.<sup>19</sup> I am grateful for the experiences and opportunities that shaped me into the person I am today.<sup>20</sup></p>
