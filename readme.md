## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details.
This project aims to create a personal website that showcases my design and web development skills, serving as a portfolio to highlight my achievements, skills, and projects. The key components of this website include five distinct pages: a resume-like page presenting my professional background, a project showcase page featuring my past work, a design layouts page showcasing my expertise in web design, an engaging overview page providing a comprehensive introduction, and potentially additional pages to enhance the website's functionality and versatility. The primary technologies used for this website will be HTML and CSS, which I will leverage to create a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly website that effectively communicates my capabilities as a web designer and developer.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
